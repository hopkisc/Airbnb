## Project Motivation

The aim of this project was to use Edinburgh Airbnb data to answer the three following questions: 

1. Are Guests More Likely to Leave Reviews if Dissatisfied?
2. Which Features Are Most Likely to Influence the Rating Provided?
3. How Can You Increase the Chance of Your Property Getting Rated Highly?

## File Descriptions

Improving Ratings.ipynb contains all the documented code used for this analysis.
